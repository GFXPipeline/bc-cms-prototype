It is put in place to prohibit access to areas where there are ongoing fire suppression activities occurring, to limit the risk of wildfire occurring or to address a public safety concern. Restricted Area Orders are established to enforce the continued need to protect the public and emergency service personnel in active wildfire areas.</p><p>When a Restricted Area Order is established under section 11(2) of the Wildfire Act, a person must not remain in or enter the restricted area without the prior written authorization of an official designated for the purposes of the Wildfire Act, unless the person enters the area only in the course of:</p><ul><li>Travelling to or from his or her residence;</li><li>Using a highway as defined in the Transportation Act;</li><li>Travelling through or entering the area as a person acting in an official capacity that is connected or involved in incident operations ; or</li><li>Travelling through or entering the area for a purpose approved by an official of supporting wildfire suppression activities.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>When an area restriction is in place the “Forest Use” icon on the <a href="http://bcfireinfo.for.gov.bc.ca/hprScripts/WildfireNews/Bans.asp">Fire Bans &amp; Restrictions</a> page will turn yellow. Each Fire Centre has the heading “Forest Use Restrictions” that will display maps and information bulletins for Restricted Areas that are in place.</p><p>All trails and backroads that are not included within the boundary of Restricted Area Orders, Evacuation Orders, or are otherwise under municipal jurisdiction, remain open for public use.</p><p><a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status/fire-bans-and-restrictions">Frequently Asked Questions</a></p><p><strong>Q: Why is the use of fire banned?</strong></p><p>A: The decision when or where to implement a fire ban is made by the regional fire centres depending on local fire hazards or dangers, the type of weather conditions forecasted and the type and level of fire activity being experienced.</p><p>Bans can also be implemented in anticipation of an increase in lightning-caused fires or during critical fire situations, when the BC Wildfire Service cannot afford to risk having human-caused fires divert resources from naturally-caused ones.</p><p>In these situations, fires present an unacceptable risk and detract from detection and response capabilities by increasing the number of ‘false-alarm’ smoke chases, wildfire phone reports and nuisance fires.</p><p><strong>Q: Where do fire bans and restrictions apply?</strong></p><p>A: The Wildfire Act and Regulation, and therefore fire bans and restrictions, apply on Crown land and private land not covered by local open burning bylaws put in place by local government (i.e. municipalities, regional districts).</p><p>This includes municipal and privately owned campgrounds not covered by municipal bylaws, forestry recreation sites and provincial and federal parks. BC Parks may also designate certain BC Parks campsites as ‘no campfire’ locations.</p><p><strong>Q: How do I find out if there is a fire ban or restriction in place?</strong></p><p>A: For open fires and campfires on Crown land and private land see <a href="http://bcfireinfo.for.gov.bc.ca/hprScripts/WildfireNews/Bans.asp">Current Bans and Restrictions</a>.</p><p>But, as these restrictions do not include areas which are within the boundaries of local government and subject to local bylaws, you should also check with local government authorities before lighting any fires.</p><p>Before lighting a campfire it is also important to check the campfire policy for the campground you are staying in. For BC Parks campgrounds, see the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/fire-restrictions.html">Provincial Parks Affected by Fire Restrictions</a>&nbsp;page,&nbsp;plus&nbsp;the notes for the particular campground you’re interested in, on the BC Parks website.</p><p><strong>Q: It has been raining for several days in my region, why is there still a fire prohibition?</strong></p><p>A: While the risk of wildfire in your area may have decreased, the provincial wildfire situation may be different and more active. As a result, personnel from across the province may be responding to fires outside of their regional and fire centre boundaries, limiting the amount of resources available in wetter areas.</p><p>In these situations, fires also present an unacceptable risk and detract from detection and response capabilities by increasing the number of ‘false-alarm’ smoke chases, wildfire phone reports and nuisance fires.</p><p><strong>Q: Why are large, land clearing pile fires allowed when smaller fires are prohibited?</strong></p><p>A: Current procedures require all Category 3 open fires, including land clearing piles, to be registered. This makes it relatively easy to revoke or reinstate these registration numbers as local weather impacts fire danger. BC Wildfire Service encourages the reduction of wildfire hazard from land clearing debris and has found the flexibility of the burn registration process useful to allow safe burning of large piles when weather is favourable.</p><p>To register a Category 3 open fire, please call 1 888 797-1717 toll free.</p><p><strong>Q: What happens if I have a fire when a prohibition is in place?</strong></p><p>A: Anyone found in contravention of a fire prohibition may be fined up to $1,150. If your fire escapes and results in a wildfire, you may be fined anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million and be sentenced to one year in prison.</p><p>Full list of <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status/about-bcws/governance/legislation-regulations/summary-of-fines">wildfire-related violation fines in B.C</a>.</p><p><strong>Q: What can I use when there is a campfire ban in place?</strong></p><p>A: Some activities and devices are permitted when a campfire ban is in place and some are not. This varies depending on the prohibition itself; check details of the <a href="http://bcfireinfo.for.gov.bc.ca/hprScripts/WildfireNews/Bans.asp">current bans and restrictions</a>.</p><p>Often, campfire prohibitions still allow the use of CSA-rated or ULC-rated cooking stoves that use gas, propane or briquettes, or of portable campfire apparatus that use briquettes, liquid fuel or gaseous fuel, as long as the height of the flame is less than 15 cm tall. <strong>However</strong>, in extreme fire conditions these may also be prohibited</p><p>Often, other activities are also prohibited when Category 2 open fire and/or campfire prohibitions are in force, these include:</p><ul><li>Larger fires (Category 2 and Category 3)</li><li>Burning barrels and burning cages</li><li>Fireworks, fire crackers, sky lanterns</li><li>Binary exploding targets</li></ul><p>Check <a href="http://bcfireinfo.for.gov.bc.ca/hprScripts/WildfireNews/Bans.asp">current bans and restrictions</a> for full details.</p>',

Currently, the federal government departments collect and pay GST at the rate of 5% in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia.</p><p>With respect to the provincial sales tax (PST), departments charge and collect 8% on taxable supplies in Ontario and 7% on taxable supplies in British Columbia. Departments are exempt from the PST and therefore do not pay PST on their purchases in these two provinces.</p><p>As of July 1, 2010, the GST and the PST in Ontario and British Columbia will be replaced by the HST.</p><p>Legislation to enact the HST has been passed into law by the Governments of Canada and Ontario. The HST in Ontario, effective July 1, 2010 will be 13% consisting of the 5% federal part and an 8% provincial part.</p><p>Similar legislation is expected to be introduced soon in the province of British Columbia and, subject to legislative approval, would also provide for the implementation of HST in British Columbia beginning July 1, 2010. The HST in British Columbia would be 12% consisting of the 5% federal part and a 7% provincial part.</p><p>Both the Ontario and British Columbia governments have issued Tax Information Notices outlining the general transition rules in support of their implementation of the HST.</p><p>The Tax Information Notice for Ontario is found on the following website: <a href="http://www.rev.gov.on.ca/en/notices/hst/03.html">http://www.rev.gov.on.ca/en/notices/hst/03.html</a></p><p>The Tax Information Notice for British Columbia is found on the following website:<a href="http://www.sbr.gov.bc.ca/business/Consumer_Taxes/Harmonized_Sales_Tax/HST_Transitional_Rules.html">http://www.sbr.gov.bc.ca/businsess/Consumer_Taxes/Harmonized_Sales_Tax/</a><br><a href="http://www.sbr.gov.bc.ca/business/Consumer_Taxes/Harmonized_Sales_Tax/HST_Transitional_Rules.html">HST_Transitional_Rules.html</a></p><p>As well, the Canada Revenue Agency provides detailed information that explains the transition to HST. <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/gncy/hrmnztn/menu-eng.html">http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/gncy/hrmnztn/menu-eng.html</a></p><p>This bulletin is intended to assist you and your department in identifying changes that will be necessary in your department. Please note that this is a guidance document only. The legislative authority is Part IX of the Excise Tax Act. The framework for the harmonization of the provincial sales taxes with the goods and services tax is set out in the respective Comprehensive Integrated Tax Collection Agreements with Ontario and British Columbia.</p><p>The attached annex highlights the major changes outlined in the Ontario and British Columbia Tax Information Notices. Even though complete policy and administrative details have not yet been issued, departments should familiarize themselves with all the transitional provisions included in the two Tax Information Notices and begin the process of assessing the changes required to their financial systems, GST/HST rate references on documentation such as invoices, contracts, internet web sites, point of sale systems and departmental policies, processes and procedures in order to comply with the HST requirements in Ontario and British Columbia. <strong>Please be aware that the HST would apply to consideration that becomes due, or is paid without becoming due, on or after May 1, 2010 for property and services provided on or after July 1, 2010.</strong></p><p><strong>In addition, information on the winding down of the provincial sales taxes is included.</strong></p><p>The HST in Ontario and British Columbia is similar to the HST introduced in several Atlantic Provinces in 1997. As such major changes to systems and to procedures should not be required past the transitional phase. Training may be required for transitional considerations and for employees not familiar with the HST.</p><p>The Office of the Comptroller General will continue to issue bulletins as updated information becomes available.</p><h2 id="inquiries">Inquiries</h2><p>Financial Management Community: Should you require further information about the application of the GST/HST and the PST in federal government departments please do not hesitate to contact Anna Marinelli CGA, Financial Management Policy Division, at 613-954-3692 or by e-mail at: <a href="mailto:Anna.Marinelli@tbs-sct.gc.ca">Anna.Marinelli@tbs-sct.gc.ca</a>;</p><p>Contracting Community: Should you require further information regarding the impact of the GST/HST on contracts, please do not hesitate to contact Mark Schizkoske, Acquired Assets and Services Sector, at 613-946-6273 or by email at <a href="mailto:Mark.Schizkoske@tbs-sct.gc.ca">Mark.Schizkoske@tbs-sct.gc.ca</a>;</p><p>Original signed by Bill Matthews</p><p>Assistant Comptroller General<br>Financial Management and Analysis Sector<br>Office of the Comptroller General</p>',
